## Hi there, I'm Anne-Sophie Vere 👋
I'm a French creative developer and web designer. I love combining clean code with strong visuals — from smart home apps to elegant websites. Currently freelancing, I craft digital tools that are both useful and bold. 

- I like to build stuff and **beautiful things**
- I also like **litterature, reading and writing.** 
- You'll usually find me coding, lost in a book, or sketching something.
  
When I’m not building for a client (or myself), I’m adding new prints to my Etsy shop.

## What I've been up to : 

- 🔧 Working on Homey apps for connected devices  
- ✍️ Designing beautiful websites with Symfony, Twig & Tailwind  
- 🎨 Running a creative illustration shop: [atelierillustre](https://atelierrecolorer.etsy.com)
